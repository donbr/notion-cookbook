# Documentation

This directory is reserved for Notion's core developer documentation, which will be migrated here in the future.

For now, please visit [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com) for:

- [API reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference)
- [Getting started guides](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
- [Integration examples](https://developers.notion.com/docs/examples)
- [Authorization documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization)

This documentation will eventually be available here as part of our move to an open-source, community-maintained documentation platform.
