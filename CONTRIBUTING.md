# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Notion cookbook. This is a community resource, and we value contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## How to contribute

### Adding examples

If you've built something useful with Notion's API and want to share it:

1. **Fork and clone** this repository
2. **Add your example** to the appropriate language directory (e.g., `examples/javascript/your-example-name/`)
3. **Include a README** that explains what the example does, what dependencies it needs, and how to run it
4. **Test your code** to make sure it works as documented
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what your example demonstrates

Examples should be:

- **Working code** that others can run with minimal setup
- **Well documented** with comments explaining key concepts
- **Focused** on demonstrating a specific integration or technique
- **Self-contained** with all necessary files and a clear README

### Adding or improving skills

To contribute an AI skill:

1. **Add your skill** to the appropriate provider directory (e.g., `skills/claude/your-skill-name/`)
2. **Include evaluations** that test the skill's effectiveness (see existing skills for examples)
3. **Document the workflow** clearly so users understand what the skill does and how to trigger it
4. **Follow best practices** outlined in the [skills README](skills/README.md)

### Improving documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or clarify instructions
- Add missing setup steps
- Improve code comments
- Expand READMEs with common troubleshooting tips

### Code style

For JavaScript/TypeScript examples:

- Use the existing examples as a style reference
- Include a `tsconfig.json` if writing TypeScript
- Format code consistently (we recommend Prettier)
- Add comments to explain non-obvious logic

For markdown documentation:

- Use sentence case for headings (not title case)
- Keep language clear and concise
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Test any links you add

## Pull request process

1. **Create a descriptive branch name** (e.g., `add-calendar-sync-example`)
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Test everything** works as expected
4. **Submit a PR** with a clear title and description
5. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers

We'll review PRs as quickly as we can. Please be patient and respectful in all interactions.
